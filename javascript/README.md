- It's Interpreted language
- because of node.js JS can be used in the backend also
- It's a dynamic language (types can be changed) [can give runtime error in big code base. that's why typescript exists]
- Single threaded
- It's considered bad language for scalable systems
- But there's a way, we can make it use all cores of a CPU [Idk the way yet]
